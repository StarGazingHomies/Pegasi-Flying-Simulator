	* For this section, a lot needs to be considered.
	* Wing stroke times depend heavily on the size of the pegasus.
	* Smaller birds tend to flap faster, so maybe a pegasus filly should flap much, much faster than an adult.
	* Like how scootaloo buzzes her wings on the scooter
	* No idea if biology allows for this type of muscle development though.
	* 
	* That's something to worry about later, for now, estimate the adult consts.
	* Times are for a full stroke (up and down).

	* 
	* Note: Humurus/Ulna/Manus are the three sections (name of bones) of a bird's wing
	* but the wingspan also includes primary feather length!
	* 
	* Again, no idea how big a pegasus is relative to a human.
	* If we use IRL pony size as a reference... well, ponies don't fly
	* But the wandering albatross has the biggest wingspan of 2.51~3.5 (mean 3.1)m
	* And weighs 6.35-11.91 (mean depending on place, but prolly 9.1)kg
	* (Source: Wikipedia. Yeah, I'm not proud of it)
	* 
	* However, wingspan also has a relationship with mass to consider
	* 
	* Total arm length related to weight^0.42 approximately
	* Primary feather length related to arm length^0.82 ish
